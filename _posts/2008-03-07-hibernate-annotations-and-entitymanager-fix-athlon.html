<a href='http://annotations.hibernate.org'>Hibernate Annotations</a> 3.3.1.CR1 and <a href='http://entitymanager.hibernate.org'>Hibernate EntityManager</a> 3.3.2.CR1 are available for download <a href='http://www.hibernate.org/6.html'>here</a>. I have done a fix-athlon in the last few days to ready them for JBoss AS 5.<br/>There is a ton of bug fixes especially in the Java Persistence scanning area and in edge mapping supports.<br/>Some minor new features have been added as well (transparent integration with the latest <a href='http://search.hibernate.org'>Hibernate Search</a> collection events, @Any, @NaturalId).<br/><br/>Check the changelogs <a href='http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/ANN?report=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project:changelog-panel'>here</a> and <a href='http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/EJB?report=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project:changelog-panel'>here</a>.<br/><br/>Unless huge bugs are discovered, these versions will be embedded in the next JBoss AS 5 release.<br/><br/>Go try them.
