<p>I've spent my Sunday working on the backlog of my pictures. I'm far from done but this one really stroke me.
</p>
<p>I took the picture last month in Bruges, Belgium with a Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX3 (<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/27291554@N02/5154314015/meta/'>more metadata information here</a> for the curious).

<p>I don't think the camera made a big difference as the light was easy that day and I shot from 100-150 meters. This is nevertheless a great compact camera and <a href='http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/PanasonicDMCLX3'>Gavin did a nice review of it</a>.</p>
