<p>I am one of the "few" that have been <a href='http://blogger-ftp.blogspot.com/2010/01/deprecating-ftp.html'>let down</a> by Blogger. They no longer support FTP export which makes it a no go for me.
</p>
<p>I've decided to move over to a self hosted Wordpress. It was a very easy process overall, this blog summarizes the few steps needed.
</p>
<strong>1. Install Wordpress</strong>
<p>The first step is to install Wordpress. My provider offers a very easy install via SimpleScript.
</p>
<p>I have personally installed Wordpress in a subdirectory of my blog site to avoid messing with the existing files.
</p>
<strong>2. Find a theme you like</strong>
<p>Moving along, nothing to see here. Pick and chose from the theme explorer in the admin console of Wordpress.
</p>
<strong>3. Move your Blogger blog from FTP publishing to</strong> <em><strong>myrandomblog</strong></em><strong>.blogspot.com publishing</strong>
<p>For the import to work, you need to expose your Blogger blog as a blogger hosted website. Don't worry, since your blog is already published, your users will still be able to access it while you are messing around.
</p>
<strong>4. Create a user (optionally)</strong>
<p>By default, the user is <em>admin</em> but you can create a dedicated user (in my case <em>emmanuel</em>).
</p>
<strong>5. Import your posts and comments</strong>
<p>In the Wordpress admin console, go to Tools, select import, Blogger, the specific blog you want to import (in this case <em>myrandomblog</em>), and click. You can optionally associate your posts to a user in Wordpress ( hence step 4. :) )
</p>
<strong>6. Adjust the .htaccess (if in a subdirectory)</strong>
<p>In the root directory of your website create an .htaccess file if you don't have one already and add the following rule.
</p>
<blockquote>DirectoryIndex index.php wordpress/index.php
<p>&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
</p>
<p>RewriteEngine On
</p>
<p>#point to the wordpress directory
</p>
<p>RewriteBase /wordpress/
</p>
<p>RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
</p>
<p>RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !^atom.xml$
</p>
<p>RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !^feed$
</p>
<p>RewriteRule . /wordpress/index.php [L]
</p>
<p>&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</p>
</blockquote>
<strong>7. Adjust your feed to point to Feedburner (optional)</strong>
<p>If you use feedburner and want your feeds to point to the feedburner feed, install FD Feedburner Plugin (from the Wordpress admin console, select Plugins-&gt; add new
</p>
<p>Then burn your feed in feedburner (or reburn it if you already have a feedburner feed). The URL to burn is typically blog.mywebsite.com/feed
</p>
<p>Copy your feedburner feed URL in the Feedburner plugin configuration (you can reach it form the Plugins menu).
</p>
<p>Note, you can also burn your comments feed using the same solution.
</p>
<strong>8. Redirect your old feed to the Wordpress feed</strong>
<p>Blogger publishes your feed in <em>atom.xml</em> by default (unless you have overridden that in the publishing panel). Let's redirect the old feed to the new feed, you don't want to lose your existing followers, do you?
</p>
<p>In your <em>.htaccess</em> file, add the following line
</p>
<blockquote>Redirect permanent /atom.xml /feed</blockquote>
<p>You might have noticed that one of the RewriteCond rules is about the <em>atom.xm</em>l file. If your feed is publicly available to a different file, change that as well.
</p>
<strong>9. Do not delete your old .html files (optional)</strong>
<p>I've decided not to delete the old .html files that were pushed by Blogger. My reason was to let old references to still work. It's up to you.
</p>
<p>And you are done. Happy blogging :)</p>
