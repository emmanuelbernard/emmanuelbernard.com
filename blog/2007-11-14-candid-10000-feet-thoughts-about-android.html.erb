<a href='http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/android_overview.html'>Android</a> is the new mobile platform developed by Google. They released the <a href='http://code.google.com/android/'>SDK</a> yesterday. Basically a Linux kernel, a mobile optimized virtual machine running Java, and a set of API to play with the phone.<br/><br/>First of all, the usual disclaimer. I am not a mobile developer, I am not much of a UI developer, but I am a Java developer and mobile consumer. Anyway, I'll give you some of my thoughts.<br/><br/>Android is yet another platform. We already had Symbian, Palm OS, Windows Mobile, Java ME, Mac OS X, you name it. So yet another platform to support when writing a mobile app, year!<br/><br/>Sounds pretty bad for Sun and Java ME. I don't know the specific deal that Sun did with Google for embedding the Java technology into Android but I hope it's a good one for Sun because Java ME will suffer from the Android platform:<br/><ul><li>it's "Java" enough for people to think twice before writing a Java ME app</li><li>it's not Java ME, it's not Java SE, it's a subset of Java SE, so practically a different platform to target</li><li>it's not a Java VM, so no need to pay any IP-related royalties to Sun<br/></li><li>it's not the Sun's Java ME virtual machine, so no need to pay Sun some license fee</li></ul>Last grief. From the <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FJHYqE0RDg'>live demo</a> you can watch on Youtube (especially minute 3:32), they have a long way to go before having a UI as responsive as the iPhone at least in the screen touch area. Plus they probably don't have multi touch events yet ;p<br/><br/>That being said, it seems to be a smart move from Google in three ways:<br/><ul><li>it's a free platform for any mobile constructor (quite appealing)<br/></li><li>the notion of <a href='http://code.google.com/android/intro/anatomy.html'>intent</a> allows the user to replace one application with another in a very sleek way (sort of the loose coupling dream made true), making Android potentially an open platform even for the user<br/></li><li>they leverage all the Java developer base<br/></li></ul>Plus you can define your UI declaratively (XML), that's a smart move too.<br/><br/>So Android is a very open platform, but don't forget one thing: it's so open that your phone carrier can lock it down as much as it wants :)<br/><br/>As an iPhone user, I'm relieved a bit, my investment is worthwhile.
