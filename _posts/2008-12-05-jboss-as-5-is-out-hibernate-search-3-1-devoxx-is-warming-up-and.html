<p>Great news this week:</p><ul>  <li><a href='http://dandreadis.blogspot.com/2008/12/jbossas-500ga-released.html'>JBoss AS 5 is out</a>. Congratulations to Dimitris and the many people in and out of JBoss who contributed to it.</li><br/> <li><a href='http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/HibernateSearch31IsOutPerformanceRobustnessAndNewFeaturesOnTheMenu'>Hibernate Search 3.1 is out</a>. A lot of good stuffs like performance improvements at indexing and querying time and some cool new features like the analyzer declaration framework (allowing declarative phonetic, synonym, n-gram indexing and searches)</li><br/> <li><a href='http://www.devoxx.com/display/JV08/Home'>Devoxx</a> is very close. Come see the <a href='http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/JBossAtDevoxx'>JBoss folks and topics</a> and come to the <a href='http://devoxx.com/display/JV08/Seam+meetup'>Seam meetup</a> after the BOF of course :)</li></ul><p>Also, on the Bean Validation (JSR 303) side, I am finalizing the last changes in the spec for the public draft. We made a lot of progress in the last two weeks on various subjects including type-safe groups and JPA / JSF / EE integration (with the finalized draft, I will officially contact the EE expert group). Stay tuned, hopefully the draft should be out in a week or two.</p><p>Finally, <a href='http://www.manning.com/affiliate/idevaffiliate.php?id=952_117_1_24'>Hibernate Search in Action</a> is supposed to be released in final PDF monday (still not believing in it till I see that one ;) ).</p><p>Great week on my side.
