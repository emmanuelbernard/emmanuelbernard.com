<p>There is a tiny little utility that let's you inspect JAR/WAR/EAR files on the Mac OS platform. The software is available <a href='http://www.codeland.org/'>here</a>. Install it. To open a JAR, simply right click and chose JarInspector as the application. I personally did not set JarInspector as my default .jar application to let the default JAR launcher kicks in but I have been very close to.</p><p>Amongst the useful features:</p><ul>  <li>navigate in your jars recursively</li>  <li>edit/view files (useful for MANIFEST.MF)</li>  <li>decompile a class</li>  <li>find a file/class by name</li></ul><p>By the way, this utility also opens zip files.</p><p>Enjoy.</p>
