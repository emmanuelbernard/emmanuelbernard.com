This is not new by any means but I recently saw this joke. As a recent dog owner
I must admit I found it too true to not laugh.

## Excerpts from a Cat's diary

Day 983 of my captivity. 

My captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. 
They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while the other inmates and I are fed hash or some sort of 
dry nuggets. Although I make my contempt for the rations perfectly clear, I nevertheless must eat something 
in order to keep up my strength. The only thing that keeps me going is my dream of escape. 
In an attempt to disgust them, I once again vomit on the carpet. 

Today I decapitated a mouse and dropped its headless body at their feet. I had hoped this would strike fear 
into their hearts, since it clearly demonstrates what I am capable of. However, they merely made condescending 
comments about what a "good little hunter" I am. Bastards!

There was some sort of assembly of their accomplices tonight. I was placed in solitary confinement for the duration of the event. 
However, I could hear the noises and smell the food. I overheard that my confinement was due to the power of "allergies". 
I must learn what this means, and how to use it to my advantage. Today I was almost successful in an attempt to assassinate 
one of my tormentors by weaving around his feet as he was walking. I must try this again tomorrow but at the top of the stairs.

I am convinced that the other prisoners here are flunkies and snitches. The dog receives special privileges. He is regularly released
and seems to be more than willing to return. He is obviously retarded. The bird has got to be an informant. I observe him 
communicate with the guards regularly. I am certain that he reports my every move. My captors have arranged protective custody 
for him in an elevated cell, so he is safe, for now...
