<p>I will be speaking at <a href='http://www.devnexus.com/'>DevNexus</a>. This small conference is a spin off the Atlanta Java User Group.</p><p>Here are a few things I like about the conference personally:</p><ul>  <li>There is around 10 presentations over two days, so you will be able to see all / most of them.</li>  <li>The price is very reasonable ($150 for early birds), $185 regular price.</li>  <li>The size is reasonable, so interacting with speakers is natural.</li>  <li>Atlanta in March is very nice.</li>  <li>ahem, I will be speaking there, ahem.</li></ul><p>I will personally speak about our experience in scaling Hibernate in big environments and how SaaS vendors can face the challenge. I will also discuss Hibernate Shards and Hibernate Search with regard to scalability. And there are nine other speakers at the conference, so check their <a href='http://www.devnexus.com/'>website</a>.</p>
