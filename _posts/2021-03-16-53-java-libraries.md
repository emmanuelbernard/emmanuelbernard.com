Max Andersen asked something interesting over the week-end [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/maxandersen/status/1370808620162682881).

> What is an example of a java library that solved your problem just nicely ? Can be anything as long as available as a jar somewhere :)  

Lo and behold! He received a lot of propositions.
Some by very interested parties (aka ads) but hey, I left them in, I did no editorial selection.
This is an interesting list of libraries to review a few at a time and might give you ideas.

I only added minor personal comments here and there but often _only quoted the tagline of each project in italic_.

_Roaster introduces a fluent interface to manipulate Java source files, like adding fields, methods, annotations and so on._

[JavaPoet](https://github.com/square/javapoet): _: A Java API for generating .java source files._

[Failsafe](https://jodah.net/failsafe/): _Fault tolerance and resilience patterns for the JVM_.
_Failsafe is a lightweight, zero-dependency library for handling failures in Java 8+. It has a concise API for handling everyday use cases and the flexibility to handle everything else. Failsafe works by wrapping executable logic with one or more resilience  policies, which can be combined and  composed  as needed._

_Never write another getter or equals method again, with one annotation your class has a fully featured builder, Automate your logging variables, and much more._

[Guava](https://guava.dev/): _Guava is a set of core Java libraries from Google that includes new collection types (such as multimap and multiset), immutable collections, a graph library, and utilities for concurrency, I/O, hashing, caching, primitives, strings, and more!

A first step towards functional programming is to start thinking in immutable values. Vavr provides immutable collections and the necessary functions and control structures to operate on these values. The results are beautiful and just work._

## Base libraries
