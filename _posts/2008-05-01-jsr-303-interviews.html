<p>I have been talking, writing, preaching <a href='http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=303'>Bean Validation</a> in the past six months.<br/>A few interesting links came up recently:<br/><ul><li>The <a href='http://in.relation.to/tag/Bean+Validation+Sneak+Peek'>list of blog entries</a> I wrote. Probably the most palatable content but long.<br/></li><li>An <a href='http://javaposse.com/index.php?post_id=331881'>interview</a> with Dick Wall and Carl Quinn from the Javaposse I did at Javapolis 07 (newly renamed <a href='http://javoxx.com'>Javoxx</a>) . I hated to listen to myself, hopefully you won't. The interview also covers Hibernate Search, Seam and Web Beans.<br/></li><li>An <a href='http://www.infoq.com/articles/emmanuel_bernard_interview'>article</a> published by InfoQ that goes beyond the standard set of questions on JSR 303<br/></li></ul>Many thanks to Dick and Charles for setting the interviews up.<br/><br/>Free bonus: a very interesting <a href='http://lifehacker.com/385296/where-you-find-the-time'>talk</a> about free time and participation in a post TV-only age. No relation to Java, not by me, so surely very interesting :o)</p>
