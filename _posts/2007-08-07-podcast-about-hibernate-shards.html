<p>Max Ross and Maulik Shah from the <a href='http://shards.hibernate.org/'>Hibernate Shards</a> team at Google got interviewed by the <a href='http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2007/08/google-developer-podcast-episode-six.html'>Google Developer Podcast</a>.<br/>It's a nice and easy access 30 mins introduction of Hibernate Shards: how does it work, where does it come from, what are Hibernate Shards do's and don'ts, what's the secret plan to take over the world... Insightful. One of the cool stuffs they added in the latest beta is support for Hibernate Annotations.<br/>If you want to know what shards is all about or if your DB starts to feel the heat, go get your headset.</p>
