<p>Mike Cannon-Brookes from Atlassian has posted (some moons ago) <a href='http://blogs.atlassian.com/rebelutionary/archives/2007/04/my_serverside_java_symposium_2007_presen.html'>two interesting presentations</a> related to Lucene and Atlassian's feedbacks from Confluence and JIRA.<br/><br/>My favorite is the first one: <span style='font-style: italic;'>Lucene: Generic Data Indexing</span>. It's a nice introduction to the benefits of Full Text search engines, as well as the gotchas you will face.<br/>I found their use of FilterQuery as a cross-cutting concern implementation for security fairly interesting.<br/><br/>The first presentation also quickly address some of the indexing strategies (synchronous / asynchronous) depending on the product requirements. Mike goes a bit deeper in the second one by describing some clustering solutions and the one they choose.<br/><br/>JIRA has gone very far in its use of Lucene, I am not sure I would have gone that far, but that's definitively a very interesting extreme use case, and very successful :)</p>
