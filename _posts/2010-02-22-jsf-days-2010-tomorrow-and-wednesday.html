<p>If the gods of French and German strikes allow me, I will be speaking at the <a href='http://jsfdays.irian.at/main/index.jsf'>JSF Days conference</a> organized by Irian.
</p>
<p>I will first talk about Hibernate Search and how the magic of approximation works in Full-text search and the next day I will cover Bean Validation and how it integrates in the Java ecosystem and <a href='http://www.jboss.org/jbossas'>JBoss AS 6</a> Milestone 2.
</p>
<p>Come and say hi if you are in the Vienna area.</p>
