<p>I've just found solutions to two nagging problems I had on Mac OS X.
</p>
<h3>iTunes and incoming connection requests</h3>
<p>Some times ago, iTunes has started to ask me every time it launches "Do you want the application “iTunes.app” to accept incoming network connections?". It gets quickly annoying.
</p>
<p>There is a very simple solution. Move iTunes.app (from /Applications) to your trash, <a href='http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/'>download iTunes</a> and install it. The first time you start it, iTunes will ask you to change your firewall settings. Do so and you will be good to go.
</p>
<p>If you want to know the tiny details, somehow your iTunes package got changed or corrupted and the firewall was not trusting iTunes anymore.
</p>
<h3>VPN connection after sleep</h3>
<p>Another problem I had was that after the laptop goes to sleep, it is sometimes impossible to reconnect to a VPN. If that happens, you need to restart the right daemon. Open a terminal and run
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo launchctl stop com.apple.racoon
</p>
<p>sudo launchctl start com.apple.racoon
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are now able to connect to your VPN again.</p>
