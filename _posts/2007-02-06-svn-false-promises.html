<p>I've had to do a massive project refactoring. To be more specific, I had to split Hibernate Annotations in several pieces and make Hibernate Validator and Hibernate Search independent projects (stay tuned). Of course, I wanted to keep track of my changes history.<br/>Supposedly, SVN is greater than CVS in this area, it can keep track of object renaming and copying without loosing tracks.<br/><br/>I've never had such troubles in a long time. A few tricks:<br/> - IntelliJ package renaming is great but don't try to do too much in one commit: nothing is more annoying than a cryptic version control error after a complex refactoring.<br/> - <span style='font-family: courier new;'>svn move</span> of complex structure does not seems to work properly in local move: prefer using the <span style='font-family: courier new;'>svn move url1 url2</span>. For the record, SVN ended up moving part of my tree without any complaints :-(<br/> - don't expect to update a directory and move/rename it, SVN will actually prevent you to do so (at least the complex one I had)<br/><br/>So I ended up branching, committing my package renaming, doing server side <span style='font-family: courier new;'>svn move</span> of my packages around the different projects. I wish I could have done that in an atomic way with no branching.<br/><br/>I'm not a SVN expert, but I usually don't expect my tools to require a PhD in version control, and a driver license to use them. There are huge rooms for improvements here. Think users :-)<br/><br/>For me SVN is not really better than CVS (except the local diff/revert).</p>
