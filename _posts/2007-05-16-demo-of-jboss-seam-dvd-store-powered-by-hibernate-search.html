<p>Many asked me if the DVD Store demo powered by Hibernate Search that I ran at JavaOne was available online.<br/>The answer is not yet, but it will. My plan is to package it nicely and release it when the beta 2 of Hibernate Search is out.<br/>This will hopefully happen fairly soon. JavaOne being behind us, I can focus back on the code base.<br/><br/>I had some very interesting discussions with some of you about Lucene and the features you need, it's good to see the community growing around the project.</p>
