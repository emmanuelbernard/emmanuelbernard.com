I have been fed up with Wordpress for a while now. Having to upgrade the core 
plus an average of 4 plugins every time I went to blog was too much. And I
am not even mentioning the security risk or the fact that some services
flag wordpress installs as malicious websites...
 
I have been wanting to migrate the blog to [Awestruct][awestruct] for a while
but frankly got lazy. My core website was already generated with Awestruct 
and I wanted to give [Twitter Bootstrap][bootstrap] a try. Twitter Bootstrap
is a CSS / javascript / HTML 5 toolkit to get started quickly.

So I started with that and moved my main website to use Twitter Bootstrap.
While I was at it, I have  refreshed both content and style to get:

- less chatty pages: especially the home page
- better page titles
- add a section on what projects I work on

And boom, I decided to go all in and also update my blog, importing them from
Wordpress. I'll give my feedback on both Twitter Bootstrap and moving a blog
in a later post. But let me tell you, the actual content migration was the 
easy part. Realizing after the fact that a couple of 301 redirects were
mandatory for Google to be happy was an interesting experience :)

Anyways, let me know what you think of [the website and blog refresh][website].
