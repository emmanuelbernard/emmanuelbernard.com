<p>I have recently been interviewed by Kenneth Rimple for the <a href='http://techcast.chariotsolutions.com/'>Chariot TechCast</a>.</p><blockquote>  <p>In this podcast, we speak to JBoss's Emmanuel Bernard on the future of validation using JSR-303, the Bean Validation framework. JSR-303 aims to provide an annotation-driven mechanism to mark plain old java beans with annotations, such as <span class='Apple-style-span' style='font-style: italic;'>@NotNull</span>, <span class='Apple-style-span' style='font-style: italic;'>@Min</span>, <span class='Apple-style-span' style='font-style: italic;'>@Max</span>, and can support custom validation annotations as well.</p>  <p>JSR-303 is part of the Java EE 6 suite of JSRs and will be used automatically out of the box by frameworks such as JSF 2.0. Emmanuel also goes into some detail about the current state of Hibernate Search.</p></blockquote><p>You can listen to it <a href='http://techcast.chariotsolutions.com/index.php?post_id=449889'>here</a>Â or register to <a href='http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=276488929'>iTunes</a>.</p>
