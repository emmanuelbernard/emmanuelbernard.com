## Book description

![image-left](/images/hsia-cover-medium.jpg){: .align-left}

Good search capability is one of the primary demands of a business application. 
Engines like Lucene provide a great starting point, but with complex applications 
it can be tricky to implement. It's tough to keep the index up to date, deal with 
the mismatch between the index structure and the domain model, handle querying 
conflicts, and so on.

Hibernate Search is an enterprise search tool based on Hibernate Core and 
Apache Lucene. It provides full text search capabilities for Hibernate-based 
applications without the infrastructural code required by other search engines. 
With this free, open-source technology, you can quickly add high-powered search 
features in an intelligent, maintainable way.

Hibernate Search in Action is a practical, example-oriented guide for Java 
developers with some background in Hibernate Core. As the first book to cover 
Hibernate Search, it guides you through every step to set up full text search 
functionality in your Java applications. The book also introduces core search 
techniques and reviews the relevant parts of Lucene, in particular the query 
capabilities.

Hibernate Search in Action also provides a pragmatic, how-to exploration of 
more advanced topics such as Search clustering. For anyone using Hibernate or 
JBoss Seam, this book is the definitive guide on how to add or enhance search 
features in their applications.
