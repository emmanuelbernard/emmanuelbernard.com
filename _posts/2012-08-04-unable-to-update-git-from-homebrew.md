I have had problems on one machine to upgrade Git from [Homebrew][].
Let me first tell you how to fix the problem and then what homebrew is
about.

## The problem

The problem appeared when I tried to upgrade git

    brew upgrade git

It turned out to be much more complicated than I anticipated to
find the problem. The exact error message was:

    Error: Failed executing: make prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/git/1.7.11.3 CC=/usr/bin/clang CFLAGS=-Os\ -w\ -pipe\ -march=native\ -Qunused-arguments\ -mmacosx-version-min=10.7 LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib install (git.rb:49)

My environment was listed as:

It turned out that libiconv was the culprit. Simply uninstall it:

    brew remove libiconv
    brew prune
    brew cleanup

Then run `brew upgrade git` again and things should work now.

I found the inspiration [here][inspiration].

## What is homebrew anyways

Homebrew is a very easy to use and maintain package manager for 
Mac OS X environments. Anytime you want to install one of those
unix-y tools, Homebrew is your friend.

Passed the initial installation, Homebrew is as simple to use as

    brew install *something*

and you are good to go. Keeping versions up-to-date are very easy too

    # update brew itself
    brew update
    # update tools installed with brew    
    brew upgrade

For example here are a few things I have installed and maintain with 
Homebrew (aka brew for the friends).

- git
- keychain
- mvim
- mongodb
- postgresql
- rsync
- unison
- wget

That also includes some Java tools:

- gradle
- maven
- jboss-as
- ceylon

Homebrew does not install as a privileged user - it is actually discouraged.
That makes it a bit picky when permissions are not right.

I have been using [this trick][permission] quite regularly with success.
