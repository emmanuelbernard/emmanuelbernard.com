I got tired of using the graphical interface of VirtualBox to start and stop my VM.
After a little googling, I have found a very neat script that lets you control everything
from the command line.

The script is detailed on [Carlos Acosta's blog][blog] and you can download it directly [here][script].
One neat thing is that the VM is run headless. One less visual pollution floating around.
