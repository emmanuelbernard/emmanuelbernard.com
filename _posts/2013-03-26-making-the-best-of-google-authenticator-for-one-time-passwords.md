You can't reorder tokens on Google Authenticator nor edit the associated
description? Read on.

I use **one time passwords** everywhere I can. It's a little hassle but increases
security by a whole lot. And the good thing is that more and more providers
offer this:

- GMail
- Google Apps
- Dropbox
- Amazon Web Services
- Your company if they are not too dinosaur-y

**Go use one time passwords aka two factor authentication**, you will thank me
later.

I looked around on iOS and the most well known soft token application that
supports both time based and event based tokens is Google Authenticator.
Except that **Google Authenticator's UI is really crap and buggy**.

The edit button does not seem to function properly and nothing happens most of
the time. The trick is to **go to Legal information then back**. You can now **press
the edit button and voil√†! Things work**. You can now:

- reorder the list properly
- edit the name under each token

That made my life much easier.
