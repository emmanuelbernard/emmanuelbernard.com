<p>We just had our third review of <a href='http://www.manning.com/affiliate/idevaffiliate.php?id=952_117_1_24'>Hibernate Search in Action</a>. Receiving this feedback has been a humble experience. Lot's of good reviews (good) and some critical ones (even better). Every imperfection we left aside came back in the spot lights of our reviewers.</p><p>Based on this feedback, we have been working hard the last two weeks to improve a lot the manuscript:</p><ul>  <li>clearer code transcripts with more inline annotations</li>  <li>better separation between different parts of the same example (Hibernate API versus Java Persistence API)</li>  <li>the code has been updated to the latest Hibernate Search version and cleaned up a lot (no more warning, same comments as in the book)</li><li>the code now contains README files for easierÂ navigation, ant scripts, Eclipse and IntelliJ descriptors</li>  <li>a nice appendix summarizing all annotations, Hibernate Search APIs and Lucene Query classes</li>  <li>added an index: I wish I could plug Hibernate Search on the book, that one was painful</li>  <li>added a section on testing (mocking, in-memory integration testing, performance testing)</li>  <li>better explanation on how query and analyzer are interwoven</li>  <li>add the Explanation API description</li>  <li>clearer introduction for each chapter</li>  <li>much more references than before making book navigation easier</li>  <li>all references in the book are up to date. No more Chapter XX ;)</li>  <li>improvements on the clustering chapter</li></ul><p>The code is almost ready for prime time, we will publish it as soon as we find the right vehicle for it.</p><p>Thanks to all our reviewers. While I am not sure I appreciate the recent sleep depravation, this definitely improved the book a lot.</p><p>As usual, you can get the preview version electronically at <a href='http://www.manning.com/affiliate/idevaffiliate.php?id=952_117_1_24'>Manning</a>, it has all the chapters and I hope to get the latest changes uploaded soon.</p>
